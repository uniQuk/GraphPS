# Misc Graph PowerShell Scripts
There may be several scripts with similar names that produce the same output coded in different ways. Or may have more/less error handling etc.

## Connect-MgGraph
These scripts assume the user is already connected to graph with the correct scopes. They also don't do any module version checking.

## Notes:
- The scripts are not meant to be run as is, they are meant to be used as a reference
- You will need to have the correct modules installed to run these scripts
- Users should fully understand the code within the scripts before running them
- The scripts are not meant to be run in a production environment without testing

## To-Do
- Provide more context of each script
